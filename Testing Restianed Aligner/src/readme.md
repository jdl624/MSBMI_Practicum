### Change Log

1. 09/30/2019   upload an easy to use version.     
    Previous code contains lots of bulky parts for methods comparison/evaluation, now the code has been dramatically simplified.
    Code and example can be find in ./src/wsi_registration.py. 
    You just need to copy tsv file ./src/tissue_detection/tissue_others.tsv and ./src/wsi_registration.py to your project, and it's ready to run.

~~### You can go though the workflow step by step~~
~~1. get image patches(getImgPatches.py)~~
~~2. introduce image registration methods to get the raw result~~
   ~~a) rawRegister_FFT.py  FFT~~
   ~~b) rawRegister_SIFT.py SIFT~~
   ~~c) rawRegister_SIFT_ENH.py SIFT_ENH~~
   ~~d) rawRegister_ECC.py  ECC~~
~~3. use KDE filter to get KDE confidence(kde_weighting.py)~~
~~4. use hierarchical weighted linear regression to make result more robust(hierarchicalLinearRegression.py)~~
~~5. draw evaluation chart and calculate evaluation metrics(draw_eval.py and eval_err.py)~~
~~### You can also refer to an end-to-end solution for multiple pairs of WSIs~~
~~modify the data path in run_all.py and run.~~
